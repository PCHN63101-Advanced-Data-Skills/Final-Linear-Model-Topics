    "### Familywise Error\n",
    "Remembering back to our original justification for omnibus tests, we stated that the reason given is often one of error control. This perspective is much more in the Neyman-Pearson tradition than it is in the Fisherian tradition. The notion of the familywise error (FWER) is couched in Neyman-Pearson decision making and how often we would reach a false-positive conclusion over repeated tests. Fisher did not deny that calculating many $p$-values increased the chance of seeing small $p$-values. If you do something enough times, rare events will happen. However, he advocated for context and the use of the actual magnitude of the $p$-value to guide interpretation. In contrast, Neyman-Pearson wanted strict error control at a given $\\alpha$-level. To briefly review, you can calculate the probability of false-positive decisions as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{FWER} = 1 - (1 - \\alpha)^{m},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ is the number of tests being performed in the \"family\". For instance, if we only perform one test at $\\alpha = 0.05$, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{FWER} = 1 - (1 - 0.05)^{1} = 0.05.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we perform 100 tests we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{FWER} = 1 - (1 - 0.05)^{100} = 1 - 0.006 = 0.994.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we go from only a 5% probability of one or more false-positive under the null to a 99.4% probability of one or more false-positive under the null. As such, using a strict decision rule with a  fixed $\\alpha$ only works to control the error-rate when we perform a single test. As soon as we start performing multiple tests, this error rate increases because the chance of seeing a rare event also increases. It is like buying millions of lottery tickets. The chance of any single ticket winning is very low, but if we buy enough of them we can almost guarantee that *at least one* of the tickets will be a winner. We are simply providing *more opportunities* for a rare event to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher acknowledged this situation, but he rejected the idea of fixing the error-rate *a priori*. Indeed, he said\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "...the calculation is absurdly academic, for in fact no scientific worker has a fixed level of significance at which from year to year, and in all circumstances, he rejects hypotheses; he rather gives his mind to each particular case in the light of his evidence and his ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Fisher (Statistical Methods and Scientific Inference, 1956, p.42-45)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So Fisher would tell us to interpret the $p$-values in context. We do not choose a single $\\alpha$ and then stick dogmatically to it in all circumstances. Rather, our marker for \"significance\" must be context-bound and relative to the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in our modern mish-mash of NHST, it is more typical to do exactly what Fisher did *not* want and fix $\\alpha = 0.05$ in all circumstances, adjusting the results of tests to try and maintain this level irrespective of context. This is a deeply Nyman-Pearson idea, though we typically apply such corrections to Fisher's $p$-values rather than adjusting the critical value of the test."

A general heuristic is to use the `holm` method as the most general-purpose approach. This is more powerful than `bonferroni`, but has no additional assumptions. If the $p$-values are *correlated* (e.g. from repeated measurements), then `hochberg` is a better choice because it relaxes the assumption of independance, yet retains good power. If you have *a lot* of $p$-values (in the hundreds or thousands), then controlling the `fdr` is a more sensitive approach than controlling the FWER. For instance, FDR is a common method used in neuroimaging where the number of simultaneous tests across the brain can be in the hundreds of thousands.  "

In the example above, we place `origin` here so that the effect of `vs` was evaluated at each level of `origin`. Each level of `origin` therefore forms a *family* of tests with a common inferential goal and any correction is applied within each family separately. Because the `vs` factor only has two levels only a single test is performed within each family and no correction is applied. However, if we define the interaction tests the other way around, so that the levels of `vs` form the families, we can see that the correction *is* applied."

    ":class: tip\n",
    "In general, any test performed in an effort to unpack the ANOVA omnibus test is regarded as a *follow-up test*, because it follows the main ANOVA analysis. However, a distinction is sometimes made related to the *intent* behind the tests. Sometimes, follow-up tests are known as *post-hoc tests* when we have found a significant effect and then wish to break it down. Other times, follow-up tests are known as *planned comparisons* when we decided on the comparisons we wanted to make *before* running the analysis, irrespective of the omnibus results. This distinction is really between whether we wish to be guided by the omnibus tests and then exhaustively search the results to discover what the omnibus test is trying to tell us, versus deciding on a few choice comparisons before the analysis and then just sticking to those and not looking at anything else. *Post-hoc* tests are quite common in Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, whereas *planned comparisons* may be more relevant for something like a clinical trial where the only differences we care about are those between the patients and controls. \n",
    "\n",
    "The point of bringing this up is that arguments are sometimes made around error-control and the type of follow-up test we are using. For instance, it is common to hear that multiple comparisons corrections are only needed with post-hoc tests, but not with planned comparisons. This indicates that if you decide on your comparisons beforehand, you do not need to perform any sort of $p$-value correction. *Beware of this reasoning*. Although planned comparisons are more *credible* in the sense that you are not $p$-hacking, this does not change anything about the error rate. The error does not magically know what your intentions were and then change itself. The error rate is a fact of multiple testing that does not change with intent. As such, even if you have pre-specified tests, you still need to control for multiple comparisons. *Our intentions do not change the laws of probability*.\n",

    "So how do we interpret this? One approach is to use Cohen's own cutoffs of ... However, this is controversial because these values are somewhat arbitrary and realistically cannot be universally applicable in all situations. In addition, if all we are doing is determining how meaningful effects are based on arbitrary cut-offs, we are not doing much better than NHST with $\\alpha = 0.05$. The more *New Statistics* way is to interpret each effect on its own in relation to its mangitude and precision. For instance, we can see that `origin` has the largest effect, followed by `origin:vs` and then `vs` alone. Focusing on the interaction, $f^2 = 0.64^2 = 0.41$. So, the interaction's contribution to the model is 41% as large as the residual variance of the full model. This feels a bit wonky to interpret, but we need to think of the residual variance of the full model as our *noise floor*. For this model, we cannot make the noise any smaller than this value. As such, this is our benchmark by which we judge the variance reduced by a given predictor. However, this still does not feel particularly *intuitive*. The problem is that *all* omnibus effect sizes are a compromise because an omnibus effect is a *pattern* not a *quantity*. In trying to reduce this to a single number, we run into difficulties because, funamentally, an omnibus test is not related to any practical effect we are actually interested in. In a way, this idea of an \"overall effect\" is not really of much use to us and is difficult to define in any coherent way that relates to the actual differences in the data that we care about.\n",
    "   \n",
    "On this basis, it is not often worth worrying about effect sizes on omnibus tests. Indeed, from the perspective of *estimation*, omnibus tests are not really of any interest. If we take them as a form of error-control, then this is no longer relevant because we are only interested in effects and their precision, not long-run decision making. If we take them as a form of time-saving screening, this is largely unnecessary in the modern world because computers can create all the comparisons we want instantaneously. The only legitimate argument in their favour is the idea that omnibus tests can serve as an *optional noise filter*, giving you a quick global check on whether a factor has any signal worth interpreting before diving into multiple individual effects. This is more coherently expressed in the idea of finding the *best model* for the data before interpreting the effects and so will depend upon what metric is used to define \"best\" in this scenario. Indeed, we can simply replace the idea of omnibus tests with the idea of *model building* and then interpret the individual comparisons once we have a model we are happy with. This is a much more modern and coherent perspective than omnibus ANOVA tests. We will see more about model comparisons and model building in the Machine Learning module next semester."

    "Here we can see each of the comparisons between `Straight` and `V-shaped` engines expressed in standard deviation units.

This is illustrated in the plot below and gives some visual intuition behind what Cohen's $d$ is telling us."

    "So, in all cases, this is potentially an interesting effect. However, we also need to consider the precision. For he `Europe` comparison, the 95% CI is $[0.30,2.68]$, which is reasonably uncertain. It suggests that the true effect could be as small as $d=0.3$ (a tiny mean shift) or as large as $d=2.68$ (quite a large mean shift). So whilst this is at least indicative of a *positive* effect, its exact magnitude remains a bit uncertain. Similarly, the 95% CI for `USA` is $[0.04,2.87]$, which is even wider and thus even more uncertain. Finally, the interval for `Japan` is $[-3.73,0.16]$, which is even more uncertain, especially as it includes both 0 and a reversal of the direction of the effect. So, based on this, we are most confident about the estimate for `Europe`, less so about the estimate for `USA` and even less so about the estimate for `Japan`. "
