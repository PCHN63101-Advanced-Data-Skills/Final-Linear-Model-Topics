    "... Indeed, whole textbooks were written about unbalanced data (as can be seen on the *right*). So this is a topic that deserves some attention, even if it is largely *ignored* by modern teaching in Psychology. There is something of an assumption that the issues of balance have been *solved* and thus do not need considering anymore. However, this is not really true. The \"solution\" implemented by SAS and SPSS is the Type III sums-of-squares, which researchers continue to use because it is the default[^default-foot]. However, as discussed briefly last week, this approach is highly flawed.\n",

    "In this part of the lesson, we will dig deeper into the Type I/II/III debate so that you understand what each type of sums-of-squares means, when they are most appropriate to use and what the various arguments are for/against them. In general, we will be recommending Type II for 95% of all use-cases. However, it is important not to just take our word for it. Instead, it is important that you *understand* the difference and can make your own informed judgement."

    "[^default-foot]: Always be wary of defaults. If there is one way of getting an entire scientific field to adhere to a particular way of doing something without the need for any critical evaluation, simply make it the default in software. Defaults do not automatically hold some higher-level of credibility simply because they were the value that the developer picked. Many times these are well-considered, but this is not a *guarantee*. We can easily be led astray by default choices because we do not have to justify using them, only if we change them. We could call this *the default authority effect*. It is effectively a reversal of the burden of proof: deviating from defaults requires defence, whereas using defaults is treated as neutral. Yet this presupposes that the defaults are normatively sound, which is rarely demonstrated or even documented."
