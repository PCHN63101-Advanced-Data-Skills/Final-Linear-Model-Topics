    "# Introduction\n",
    "We have now reached the final lesson of this unit. Just to recap, we have discussed the basic principles behind statistical models and seen how those are applied to both simple and multiple regression. We have examined how outputs from these models can be used to assess assumptions and have seen alterations to the linear model framework that can be used when those assumptions appear violated. We have discussed the practical and philosophical basis of common inferential procedures for the parameters, as well as the controversies they have created. We have then seen how categorical predictor variables can be integrated into linear models, representative of more traditional $t$-test and ANOVA approaches. In this lesson, we will cover some final important topics that will help complete the linear model picture. Combined with everything we have covered so far, this will provide the complete framework for analysing any data set with a continuous outcome variable.\n",
